# Catarse
Catarse is a tool for quickly capturing your ideas, plans, and visual concepts. It’s designed specifically for designers and engineers who need to communicate their vision clearly—whether in client meetings or team discussions.

This open-source graphics editor allows you to create 2D illustrations with 3D support. Built on top of Three.js, it’s not meant to replace industry-standard professional tools—it serves a different, yet equally important purpose:

- Quickly sketching out ideas and concepts while they’re still fresh

- Providing visual support during live discussions and meetings

- Adding spatial depth through basic 3D perspective

- Experimenting with layouts and compositions in a lightweight, distraction-free environment

- Supporting fast, iterative workflows without unnecessary complexity

- Saving the outcomes of discussions, webinars, or workshops as raster images (e.g., PNG)




The current stable version is 1.0, featuring the core functionality:

1) Interaction with 3D primitives: add, move, scale, rotate, and delete

2) Drawing with basic brushes across different planes, depending on the selected mode

3) Layer management with the ability to hide or delete layers

4) Automatic counting and logging of objects placed on the canvas
